NodeJS CodeKit
==============

## CodeKit Alternative on NodeJS

	An attempt at in-part replicating the awesome power of [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/).

	Thank you, incident57 for providing the inspiration, unfortunately I use Windows/Ubuntu, so I
	can't make use of it's awesome might! So I made this, I hope you find it useful!

	PLEASE NOTE: This has not been entirely tested! It's very much a prototype/alpha, I do not take 
	responsibility for ruining your working directory, use with caution... Backup any directory before
	initializing the Node Server!

Features
--------

1. **Browser Refresh On Change**

    Everytime you create or change a key file in your project, NodeJS CodeKit 
    will instruct every instance of your page to refresh, ensuring all your
    displays (be it on:- Chrome, Safari , Firefox on Mac, Windows or Unix) or
    on your mobile devices and tablets (on both iOS and Android) are up to date.

2. **CSS Wizardry**

    We've all been there, you just can't get the site to look quite right, you're
    playing with rules, and sometimes it's not convenient to do it in Debugging
    Tools, or maybe you don't even have that ability.

    Well with NodeJS CodeKit, everytime a Stylesheet changes, we instruct all your
    browsers/displays to reload the stylesheets, no refresh of the page needed!

3.  **LESS Compiler**
	
	Working with LESS? We'll compile those automatically for you.

4.	**CSS & JS Minifier/Compressor**
	
	Using a YUI library, we compress all of your CSS and Javascript files, to ensure
	peak performance on your webpage.

5.	**Cross-Platform**
	
	Using only NodeJS and Node libraries (modules); we are able to bring you all of
	this, cross platform; all you need is NodeJS and you're ready to go!
